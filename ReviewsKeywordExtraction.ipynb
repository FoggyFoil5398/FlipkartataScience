    "Now this looks good but it is not very informative since there are certain words which don't really describe much meaning to our context. Like 'much', 'little', 'true', 'many' etc. are not the words a potential buyer might be interested in to know about the product. And obviously I can't make a list of these words and remove them sincec first, I don't know how much of these non-informative words are there for the products present and second, removing them may produce words that are even more misleading and irrelevant than the ones we have now. So let's try to solve the problem with something else !"

      "Review : I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.\n",

      "Review : Regarding the product, high quality materials and overall make. extremely comfortable and flattering cut. i'd love this in all the colors of the rainbow.\n",

      "Review : I am 5' 4\" and 128 lbs and could have worn the 4 or 6 but took the 6. it does run short and the length in the 6 was better than the 4 with arm hole size being the same. the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one. it has great style!\n",

      "Review : I got this dress in the mail today, and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own.\n",

      "Review : I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this \"baby doll\" style, you'll love this.\n",

      "Review : I absolutely loved this once i got it out of the package. it's a very vibrant print in the red print, almost a picnic vibe, and the material feels soft and high quality. it runs very large though, i usually take an 8 or maybe a 6, and am busty, and in this i am pretty sure i will need the 4. i almost convinced myself i had lost weight when i tried it on! but i will return the 8 and get the 4 in the red, as well as probably at least one of the other colors as i like it so much.\n",

      "Review : I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.\n",

      "Review : I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.\n",
